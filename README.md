# rando

A random Perl code generator

Perl is often referred to as a language of line-noise. It turns out that this is not only objectively untrue, but that in terms of comparing languages to line-noise, all programming languages are the same. This is mostly because of quoting constructs.

This program demonstrates this by safely executing randomly generated code in a jailed environment.
